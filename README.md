Relation classification is one of the most important semantic processing tasks in natural language processing (NLP). This study tackles Relation Extraction and Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with attention mechanisms. We explore their effectiveness in identifying semantic relationships between entities in text. The seminal SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluation. The study not only showcases the innovative approach of utilizing deep learning techniques but also presents a comprehensive framework covering data preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation methodologies. The results underscore the superior performance of the LSTM model, reaffirming the importance of sequential information in tasks of this nature. Through a comparative analysis, this project provides valuable insights into the realm of NLP and showcases the potential of sophisticated neural network architectures in advancing relation extraction techniques.
