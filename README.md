# Relation Classification using Deep Learning Techniques

Relation classification is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), focusing on identifying semantic relationships between entities in text. This project explores Relation Extraction and Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms.

## Overview

- **Objective:** To classify relationships between entities in text using deep learning techniques.
- **Dataset:** The seminal SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluation.
- **Approach:** Utilizing CNN and LSTM networks with attention mechanisms to extract and classify relations.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the text data to prepare it for model training.
  - **Model Architecture:** Designing CNN and LSTM architectures with attention mechanisms for relation classification.
  - **Evaluation Methodologies:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
